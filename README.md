# Sparrow Backend
The project is inspired by Pocketbase written by golang. My intention is to create a backend like Packetbase, put all things one file. This amazing feature will bring many applications in the future. With the power of Rust, I hope I can write such software like Packetbase. Thanks Packetbase team.

## Schedule
2022.12.19: start of the project.
